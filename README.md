rpglogger
=========

**rpglogger.com** is a web appliction for logging your progress though any RPG. It is intended to replace hand-written notes, as well as serve as a way to log your discovery in open ended sandbox-style RPGs such as those in the ElderScrolls series. The inspiration for the project is summarized in [this article on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3256830).

rpglogger allows you to track objects in the game, customize the statics that you want to track on a per-object basis, and allow you to structure things in a way that makes sense to you. Soon we'll be adding support for sharing and collaboration between users so you log things with the help your friends, or make your guide public and wiki-style for everyone. Examples of what you might track include:

-   quests
-   player and non-player characters
-   locations
-   maps
-   items, which could be anything, including (but not limited to)
    -   weapons
    -   armor
    -   apparel
    -   potions
    -   ingredients
    -   and other random stuff anywhere in the game

...and the statistics surrounding these things. It also allows open-ended note taking for any game related notes that don't fit nicely elsewhere.

The first version is being built specifically for the needs of tracking progress in [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/).
