rpglogger
=========

**rpglogger.com** is a web appliction for logging your progress though any RPG. It allows you to track objects in the game, which can include just about anything. Examples of what you might track include:

-   quests
-   player and non-player characters
-   locations
-   maps
-   items, which could be anything, including (but not limited to)
    -   weapons
    -   armor
    -   apparel
    -   potions
    -   ingredients
    -   and other random stuff anywhere in the game

...and the statistics surrounding these things. It also allows open-ended note taking for any game related notes that don't fit nicely elsewhere.

The first version is being built specifically for the needs of tracking progress in [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/).
