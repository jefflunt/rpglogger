rpglogger
=========

**rpglogger** is a web appliction for logging your progress though an RPG. It allows you to track:

-   quests
-   player and non-player characters
-   locations
-   maps
-   items, which could be anything, including (but not limited to)
    -   weapons
    -   armor
    -   apparel
    -   potions
    -   ingredients
    -   and other random stuff anywhere in the game

...and the statistics surrounding these things. It also allows an open note-taking area (called the "log book/jounral") that you can use to write notes that don't fit elsewhere, or a character blog, for example.

The first version is being built specifically for the needs of tracking progress in [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/).
