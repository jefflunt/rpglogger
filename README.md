rpglogger
=========

**rpglogger** is a web appliction for logging your progress though an RPG. It allows you to track:

-   quests
-   items
-   player and non-player characters
-   locations
-   maps

...and the statistics surrounding these things. It also allows an open note-taking area (called the "log book/jounral") that you can use to write notes that don't fit elsewhere, or a character blog, for example.

The first version is being built for the needs of tracking progress in [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/).
