rpglogger
=========

[**rpglogger.com**](http://rpglogger.com) is a web appliction for logging your progress though any RPG and building strategy guides. It is intended to replace hand-written notes, as well as serve as a way to log your discovery in open ended sandbox-style RPGs such as those in the ElderScrolls series. The inspiration for the project is summarized in [this article on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3256830).

[**rpglogger.com**](http://rpglogger.com) is, and always will be, free to use for everyone.

* Check with me if you want to tackle something so we can chat about it (jefflunt@gmail.com).  I love contributions and pull requests, but I don't want you to do a bunch of work if there's some reason a particular issue can't be addressed on right now (e.g. it's dependent on some other functionality, etc.). Just trying to save you some time.
* The issues tagged `priority queue` are the things that will get worked on in the near future, but feel free to work on anything you want. The `priority queue` tag is just a simple way to group things while letting the community know what's on the short list for development.
* If the issue you want to work on is anything but a purely visual change, there should be accompanying tests in most cases.

About
=====

[**rpglogger.com**](http://rpglogger.com) provides a virtual log book for any game.

- Log books are grouped into "sections" by type (all similar objects go together). Example section names for RPGs might be "Characters", "Armor", "Quests", or "Weapons".
- Sections have a configurable list of "attributes" that you can add/edit. For example, an "Armor" section my have attributes such as "type", "damage", or "name".
- You can add as many attributes to a section as you like. The supported data in those sections are:
    - Integer (whole numbers: great for character and item stats)
    - Boolean (true/false or checkbox-style attributes)
    - String (short text, 255 characters or less)
    - Text (much longer text, like character journal entries, back stories, and the like)

I currently use [**rpglogger.com**](http://rpglogger.com) for Skyrim, using it to record things that I discover in the game that I discover, such as:
-   Locations
-   NPCs
-   Rare items and books
-   Alchemy notes and recipes
-   Character logs (recording important events in the game, that sort of thing)

...and the statistics surrounding these things. It also allows open-ended note taking for any game related notes that don't fit nicely elsewhere.
