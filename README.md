rpglogger
=========

[**rpglogger.com**](http://rpglogger.com) is a web appliction for logging your progress though any RPG, and building strategy guides. It is intended to replace hand-written notes, as well as serve as a way to log your discovery in open ended sandbox-style RPGs, such as those in the Elder Scrolls series. The inspiration for the project is summarized in [this article on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3256830).

[**rpglogger**](http://rpglogger.com) is, and always will be, free to use for everyone.

About
=====

[**rpglogger**](http://rpglogger.com) provides a virtual log book for any game.

- Log books are divided into "sections" by type (all similar objects go together). Example section names for RPGs might be "Characters", "Armor", "Quests", or "Weapons".
- Sections have a configurable list of "attributes" that you can add to or edit. For example, a "Weapons" section might have attributes such as "type", "damage", and "name", among others.
- You can have as many attributes in a section as you like. The supported attribute types are:
    - Integer (whole numbers: great for character and item stats)
    - Boolean (true/false or checkbox-style attributes)
    - String (short text, 255 characters or less)
    - Text (much longer text, like character journal entries, back stories, and the like)

I personally use [**rpglogger**](http://rpglogger.com) for Skyrim (you might have guessed that from its visual styling), recording items and events that I encounter as I play, such as:
-   Locations
-   NPCs
-   Rare items and books
-   Alchemy notes and recipes
-   Character journals (recording important events in the game, that sort of thing)

...along with the statistics surrounding these things.
